## Introduction

Brig.ai aims to empower women by providing them with tools to advocate for their health, particularly addressing issues like medical dismissal and misdiagnosis in conditions such as PCOS and Endometriosis. We help women understand their symptoms and provide tangible next steps to self-advocate for with their healthcare providers.

## Problem Statement

Women face significant diagnostic delays and medical gaslighting due to gaps in understanding and biases in medical practice.

## Our Solution

Brig.ai provides a platform where women can educate themselves about diagnostic tests and empower themselves to advocate for proper healthcare.

## Backend Development (my contribution)

Implemented Adaboost and clustering integration to enhance diagnostic accuracy and recommend appropriate tests based on symptoms. Utilized machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Adaboost, and Kmeans clustering to predict and recommend diagnostic pathways.

## Ethical Considerations

No storage of user health data and clear disclaimers to ensure responsible use of the platform. In the future, we will be collaborating with doctors and leaders in the health field to further develop our product.
